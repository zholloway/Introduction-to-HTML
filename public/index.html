        <p>
          The web has been through several functional iterations. 
          When I was a child, I remember websites being mostly comprised of white space and black/blue fonts. 
          Pictures were scarce, and seemingly little importance was given to the aesthetics of web pages.
          As web design became more complex with the introduction of Flash and CSS elements, web sites became more visually pleasing; a company's brand could be felt through its web page design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, many companies are being given the option to design websites while having little (or zero) web design knowledge. 
          Drag-and-drop web design tools have allowed non-coders to build their own web pages by moving around functional GUI elements around the page to wherever they see fit.
          These users do not have true unlimited control over their website's design, but web page builders are becoming more and more advanced as time goes on. 
          Eventually, any layout and feature a user could want will be available in these web builders - it is only a matter of time.
